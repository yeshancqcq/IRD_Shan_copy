Although several studies ( e.g. , Raitzsch et al. , 2008 ) showed a significant effect of carbonate ion saturation on Mg incorporation in epi faunal benthic foraminifera below 3 ° C , infaunal species do not seem to be significantly influenced by carbonate ion saturation ( e.g. , Skinner et al. , 2003 ; Elderfield et al. , 2010 ) .} {In addition , we estimate that the impact of salinity is minor ( 0.2 -- 0.4 ° C ; e.g. , Dissard et al. , 2010 ) .} {Here we present the first benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca-d 18O record from the Nordic seas in order to reconstruct the ocean circulation on DO time scales .} {Accordingly , the variations in Mg/Ca are predominantly controlled by BWT .} {MATERIALS AND METHODS The study is based on the upper 7 m of piston core JM11-FI-19PC ( 62 ° 49 ′ N , 03 ° 52 ′ W ) , retrieved from a water depth of 1179 m northwest of the Faroe Islands ( during the 2011 R/V Jan Mayen cruise by the University of Tromsø ) ( Fig. 1A ) .} {The record confirms that convection similar to modern took place in the Nordic seas during interstadials with cold bottom water temperatures ( BWTs ) close to modern temperatures .} {The results show gradual and pronounced BWT increases of 2 -- 5 ° C during stadials , indicating a stop or near stop in convection .} {The BWT peaks are followed by an abrupt drop in temperature at the onset of interstadials , indicating the abrupt start of convection and renewed generation of cold deep water .} {The rise in BWT during stadials confirms earlier interpretations of subsurface inflow of warm Atlantic water below a halocline reaching > 1.2 km water depth .} {The results suggest that warm Atlantic water never ceased to flow into the Nordic seas during the glacial period ; inflow at the surface during the Holocene and warm interstadials changed to subsurface and intermediate inflow during cold stadials .} {Our results suggest that it is the vertical shifts in the position of the warm Atlantic water that cause the abrupt surface warmings .}",62.8166666666667,-3.86666666666667,"GSA","Persistent intermediate water warming during cold stadials in the southeastern Nordic seas during the past 65 k.y.","c(""Ezat, M.

Box 9140 , Boulder , CO 80301 , USA .} {The radiocarbon concentration of a parcel of water thus reﬂects the efﬁciency of air-sea gas exchange at the sea surface , plus the rapidity of the various advective and diffusive processes that have carried the surface water into the ocean interior ( see the Data Repository ) .} {This is of particular relevance to marine carbon cycling because it is primarily the average rate of equilibration between the marine and atmospheric carbon pools , set against the ﬂux of alkalinity and biologically ﬁxed carbon into the deep ocean , that determines the ocean 's inﬂuence on atmospheric CO2 ( Sarmiento and Toggweiler , 1984 ) .} {In order to assess the implications of deglacial ventilation changes recorded in the Southern Ocean for marine carbon cycling , we performed Nd isotope measurements in parallel with existing radiocarbon measurements from core MD073076 ( 44 ° 4.46 ′ S , 14 ° 12.47 ′ W , 3770 m depth ; see Fig. 1 ) ( Skinner et al. , 2010 ) .} {To avoid potential contamination due to non-selective sediment leaching , Nd isotopes have been measured in selected ﬁsh debris and mixed benthic foraminifera ( see the Data Repository ) .} {Figure 1 shows the location of core MD07 -- 3076 on the eastern ﬂank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the sub-Antarctic South Atlantic .} {This location is currently bathed in a predominantly southward-ﬂowing mixture of modiﬁed North Atlantic Deep Water ( NADW ) and Lower Circumpolar Deep Water ( LCDW ) , which feeds into the core of eastwardﬂowing Circumpolar Deep Water ( CDW ) .} {However , direct proxy evidence for a Southern Ocean role in regulating past ocean-atmosphere CO2 exchange is scarce .} {The chronology for MD07-3076 is based on planktonic radiocarbon dates corrected for variable reservoir age effects ( Skinner et al. , 2010 ) .} {Icerafted debris counts were performed on the > 150 μm size fraction of MD07-3076 , using randomized splits of at least 300 individual grains .} {Here we use combined radiocarbon and neodymium isotope measurements from the last deglaciation to conﬁrm greatly enhanced overturning and/or air-sea exchange rates relative to today , in particular during the Bølling-Allerød warm interval .} {We show that this deglacial pulse in ocean ventilation was not driven by the North Atlantic overturning alone , and must have involved an increase in the ventilation of southern - sourced deep waters .} {Our results thus conﬁrm the removal of a physical and/or dynamical barrier to effective air-sea ( CO2 ) exchange in the Southern Ocean during deglaciation , and highlight the Antarctic region as a key locus for global climate/carbon-cycle feedbacks .} {INTRODUCTION The ocean 's total carbon pool is over 60 times larger than that of the atmosphere .} {Relatively small changes in the partitioning of CO2 between the ocean and the atmosphere can therefore have a signiﬁcant impact on atmospheric CO2 concentrations , and on global climate .} {It has long been postulated that the glacial-interglacial cycles of the Pleistocene , while being paced by changes in insolation , were largely driven by ice-albedo feedbacks and changes in atmospheric CO2 ( Shackleton , 2000 ) .}",-44.0743333333333,-14.2078333333333,"GSA","North Atlantic versus Southern Ocean contributions to a deglacial surge in deep ocean ventilation","c(""Skinner, L.

"41","{This problem will be examined in more detail in Section 2 .} {1.4 .} {The Hulu Cave record and the East Asian monsoon The Hulu Cave record published by Wang et al. ( 2001 ) is a composite of δ18O data from five stalagmites each growing over some 3000 to ""40 000"" years in duration which together span the interval 75 to 11 ka ( Fig. 1A -- B ) .} {This composite record varies by 5 ‰ overall and shows six intervals characterized by high δ18O values ( low precipitation ) , which have been correlated with Heinrich events H1 to H6 , which in turn , are correlated with low δ18O ( low temperature ) intervals in the Greenland ice core records ( GRIP and GISP2 ) .} {The striking resemblance between the GISP2 and Hulu Cave records overall ( see Wang et al. , 2001 ) suggests the Hulu Cave speleothems are robustly recording climate signals .} {Hulu Cave is situated 28 km east of Nanjing ( 32 ° 30 ′ N , 119 ° 10 ′ E ; Fig. 2 ) and receives an annual rainfall of 1750 mm .} {The East Asian region is dominated by two distinct monsoon stages each year with the majority of rain ( approximately 85 % ) falling between May and September ( Fig. 3A ) .} {The Hulu Cave record is primarily controlled by variations in the East Asian summer monsoon ( EASM ) ( Wang et al. , 2001 ) and also bears close resemblance to the Dongge Cave ( 1200 km WSW of Hulu ) record ( Yuan et al. , 2004 ) controlled by both the East Asian and Indian monsoons .} {The EASM is driven by the northward migration of the intertropical convergence zone ( ITCZ ) and the contrast in sea level pressure between the Asian continent and the surrounding oceans .} {In June , a strong pressure gradient along southeastern China between the continental low pressure cell and the northwestward migration of the 200 P.C.
