"12 000" yr from "127 000" to "115 000" yr B.P. , was punctuated by a climatic oscillation about "120 000" yr ago , and ended abruptly with a rapid onset of regional glaciation during marine isotope substage ( MIS ) 5d .} {Total organic carbon was measured using a Carlo-Erba CHNS Elemental Analyzer with a standard error of 1.6 % for replicate analyses .} {AGE MODEL INTRODUCTION Sediments of Lake Baikal in southeastern Siberia contain records of past regional climatic variations .} {Glacial -- interglacial cycles controlled Baikal biogenic and lithogenic sediment ﬂuxes , resulting in the rhythmic deposition of diatomaceous ooze during interglacial periods and diatom-barren silty clay with 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed .} {E-mail : sasha@geol.sc.edu .} {The distinct rhythmic pattern in lithology and paleoproductivity indices of lake Baikal sediments permits the development of an age model using the insolation curve of June at 65 ◦ N as a tuning target by assigning the age of insolation peak to the midpoint in the most rapid transition in biogenic silica proxy .} {( Fig. 1 ) .} {This choice of tuning approach and target is justiﬁed by the strong presence of the orbital frequencies , especially the precessional signal , in the Baikal record and by radiocarbondated records of Baikal 's response to the last deglaciation .} {The biogenic silica response to insolation forcing is due to speciﬁc 0033-5894/02 $ 35.00 Copyright C 2002 by the University of Washington .} {All rights of reproduction in any form reserved .} {56 LAST INTERGLACIATION , SOUTHEASTERN SIBERIA 57 FIG. 1 .} {The Siberian equivalent of the MIS 5e -- 5d transition appears to lead the post-Eemian cold pulses in Europe and in the central North Atlantic by 5000 to 8000 yr .} {Age model for Lake Baikal record during the last climatic cycle based on tuning the maximum amplitude in the deglacial transitions in the BioSi proxy record to the maximum of the corresponding insolation peak ( Prokopenko et al. , 2001 ) .} {Ages between tie points , marked by open labeled arrows , are linearly interpolated .} {The ODP-677 oxygen isotope record ( Shackleton et al. , 1990 ) is given for comparison .} {1 , diatomaceous ooze ; 2 , silty clay ; 3 , silty clay with diatoms ; 4 , grains of coarse sand , ice-rafted detritus ( IRD ) ; 5 , angular granules ( IRD ) .} {spring hydrophysical conditions favorable for diatom production , which is high during interglacial periods .} {The dramatic declines in incoming insolation during glaciations affected the heat balance of the lake and the thermal structure of the water column , thereby fully and rapidly shutting off diatom production .} {A detailed discussion of the Baikal age model , correlation with marine oxygen isotope stages , and climatic mechanisms is given elsewhere ( Prokopenko et al. , 2001 , and references therein ) .} {Although the reliability of the age models for the last interglaciation depends heavily on the choice of tie points ( Kukla , 2000 ) , the sharp lithological changes and dramatic shifts in biogenic silica proxy response in the Baikal record at the MIS ( marine isotope substage ) 6 -- 5e transition and the MIS 5d/5c transition set the boundaries of the Baikal glacial and interglacial intervals with high conﬁdence ( Prokopenko et al. , 2001 ) .} {The millennial suborbital ( and thus `` untunable '' ) climaticenvironmental oscillations in the Baikal record about "120 000" and "103 000" yr B.P. closely correlate with the timing of the midEemian and the Montaigu cooling events in European and North Atlantic records ( as discussed below ) and thus further corroborate the utility of the constructed Baikal age model .} {Linear interpolation between the chosen age control points suggests that Baikal interglacial conditions abruptly ended at ca.
